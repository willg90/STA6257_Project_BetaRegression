## Introduction {.scrollable}

::: panel-tabset
### What is Beta Regression?

The formal introduction of beta regression is attributed to Ferrari and
Cribari-Neto in their 2004 paper, "Beta Regression for Modelling Rates
and Proportions".

-   **Definition**: A statistical technique for modeling data that
    follows a beta distribution.
-   **Key Characteristics**:
    -   Deals with continuous variables bounded between 0 and 1.
    -   Suitable for rates or proportions.

### How Beta Regression Works

-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Models the effect of predictors on the mean of a
        beta-distributed response variable.
    -   Incorporates a link function, similar to logistic regression.
    -   Estimation typically done through maximum likelihood methods.

### Applications and Importance

-   **Case Study: T**his study focuses on a crucial aspect of academic
    admissions: understanding the factors influencing the chance of
    admission into academic programs.

    Our analysis revolves around key variables: GRE scores, TOEFL
    scores, letters of recommendation (LOR), undergraduate CGPA, and
    research experience

### Objectives

-   To identify and quantify the impact of various academic and
    experiential factors on the chances of admission.
-   To employ Beta Regression, an advanced statistical method suitable
    for modeling percentages or proportions, like the chance of
    admission.
-   Our goal is not just to find which factors are significant, but also
    to understand the extent of their influence.

## Methods

::: panel-tabset
### Assumptions

-   Link appropriateness ("deviance residuals vs. indices of
    observation", at least for the logit link)

-   Models continuous random variables and assumes values are in (0, 1),
    such as rates, proportions.

-   Dependent variable is beta-distributed.

-   Missing and outliers should be addressed to allow for model fitting.

::: panel-tabset
### Description

-   This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in
    shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output
    gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular
    university.

-   This dataset includes various information like GRE score, TOEFL
    score, university rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose), LOR (Letter of
    Recommendation), CGPA, research and chance of admit.

### Best Fit Model

-   Our chosen model is specified as: chance_of_admit \~ gre_score +
    toefl_score + lor + cgpa + research."

-   The model fitting involved iteratively refining our estimates to
    maximize the likelihood of observing our data given the model.

### Model Diagnostics

-   Residuals are scattered around the zero line, which indicates that
    there are no obvious patterns such as curvature or increasing or
    decreasing spread.
-   Most residuals fall within the range of -2 to 2, which suggests that
    the model does not exhibit any significant outliers or influential
    observations.
-   The randomness in the distribution of residuals implies that our
    model meets the assumption of homoscedasticity and that the error
    variance is constant. ![](images/residuals)

## Conclusion

-   The beta regression model identified significant predictors of the
    chance of admission: GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Letters of
    Recommendation, CGPA, and Research Experience.

-   CGPA emerged as the strongest predictor, suggesting that academic
    performance in undergraduate studies is highly indicative of
    admission chances.

-   Research Experience also has a notable positive influence,
    underscoring the value of scholarly work in the admission process.

-   The study reinforces the importance of a well-rounded application,
    beyond test scores, highlighting the integral role of holistic
    review.

-   The model assumes a linear relationship between predictors and the
    logit of the admission chances, which may not capture all nuances.

-   The analysis is based on a specific dataset, which may limit the
    generalizability of the findings to other contexts or institutions.

-   Future research could explore the inclusion of interaction terms,
    non-linear relationships.
