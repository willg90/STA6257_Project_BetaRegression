## Introduction

::: panel-tabset
### What is Beta Regression?

Beta regression is a type of statistical analysis used for modeling
dependent variables that are bounded on both sides, typically between 0
and 1. It is particularly useful for variables that represent
proportions or percentages.

-   **Definition**: A statistical technique for modeling data that
    follows a beta distribution.
-   **Key Characteristics**:
    -   Deals with continuous variables bounded between 0 and 1.
    -   Suitable for rates or proportions.

### Applications and Importance

-   **Uses**:
    -   Ideal for modeling rates and proportions in finance, biology,
        and social sciences.
-   **Importance**:
    -   Provides more flexibility and accuracy for bounded data compared
        to traditional regression.

### How Beta Regression Works

-   **Mechanics**:
    -   Models the effect of predictors on the mean of a
        beta-distributed response variable.
    -   Incorporates a link function, similar to logistic regression.
    -   Estimation typically done through maximum likelihood methods.

## Methods

### Assumptions

-   Link appropriateness ("deviance residuals vs. indices of
    observation", at least for the logit link)

-   Models continuous random variables and assumes values are in (0, 1),
    such as rates, proportions, and concentration or inequality indices.

-   Dependent variable is beta-distributed.

-   Missing and outliers should be addressed to allow for model fitting.

### Equations

```         
Beta regression model function: g(μ_i )=x_i^T β=n_i where β=(β_1,...,β_k )⊤ is a k × 1 vector.  (x_(i1   ),....,x_ik)⊤ is the vector of k regressors (or independent variables or covariates) and n_i is a linear predictor.
Link function g(μ)=log⁡(μ∕(1-μ)). 
```

## Data {.scrollable}

Description:

-   This dataset was built with the purpose of helping students in
    shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output
    gives them a fair idea about their chances for a particular
    university.

-   This dataset includes various information like GRE score, TOEFL
    score, university rating, SOP (Statement of Purpose), LOR (Letter of
    Recommendation), CGPA, research and chance of admit.

## Conclusion

-   The application of beta regression models has provided valuable
    insights into predicting student admission probabilities. 

-   The analysis highlights the significance of various factors, such as
    GRE scores, TOEFL scores, CGPA, university ratings, letters of
    recommendation, and research experience.

-   The models that combined these predictors with the lowest AIC values
    and the highest pseudo R-squared scores were deemed most effective.

-   This study not only contributes to the academic understanding of
    factors influencing university admissions but also offers practical
    implications for educational institutions and policy-making.
