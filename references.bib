ABSTRACT={The linear regression model becomes unsuitable when the response variable is expressed as percentages, proportions, and rates. The beta regression (BR) model is more appropriate for the variable of this form. The BR model uses the conventional maximum likelihood estimator (BML), and this estimator may not be efficient when the regressors are linearly dependent. The beta ridge estimator was suggested as an alternative to BML in the literature. In this study, we developed the Dawoud–Kibria estimator to handle multicollinearity in the BR model. The properties of the new estimator are derived. We compared the performance of the estimator with the existing estimators theoretically using the mean squared error criterion. A Monte Carlo simulation and a real-life application were carried out to show the benefits of the proposed estimator. The theoretical comparison, simulation, and real-life application results revealed the superiority of the proposed estimator.}

abstract = {Abstract Proportional data, in which response variables are expressed as percentages or fractions of a whole, are analysed in many subfields of ecology and evolution. The scale-independence of proportions makes them appropriate to analyse many biological phenomena, but statistical analyses are not straightforward, since proportions can only take values from zero to one and their variance is usually not constant across the range of the predictor. Transformations to overcome these problems are often applied, but can lead to biased estimates and difficulties in interpretation. In this paper, we provide an overview of the different types of proportional data and discuss the different analysis strategies available. In particular, we review and discuss the use of promising, but little used, techniques for analysing continuous (also called non-count-based or non-binomial) proportions (e.g. percent cover, fraction time spent on an activity): beta and Dirichlet regression, and some of their most important extensions. A major distinction can be made between proportions arising from counts and those arising from continuous measurements. For proportions consisting of two categories, count-based data are best analysed using well-developed techniques such as logistic regression, while continuous proportions can be analysed with beta regression models. In the case of >2 categories, multinomial logistic regression or Dirichlet regression can be applied. Both beta and Dirichlet regression techniques model proportions at their original scale, which makes statistical inference more straightforward and produce less biased estimates relative to transformation-based solutions. Extensions to beta regression, such as models for variable dispersion, zero-one augmented data and mixed effects designs have been developed and are reviewed and applied to case studies. Finally, we briefly discuss some issues regarding model fitting, inference, and reporting that are particularly relevant to beta and Dirichlet regression. Beta regression and Dirichlet regression overcome some problems inherent in applying classic statistical approaches to proportional data. To facilitate the adoption of these techniques by practitioners in ecology and evolution, we present detailed, annotated demonstration scripts covering all variations of beta and Dirichlet regression discussed in the article, implemented in the freely available language for statistical computing, r.},

The proposed model is useful for situations where the variable of interest is continuous and restricted to the interval (0, 1) and is related to other variables through a regression structure. The regression parameters of the beta regression model are interpretable in terms of the mean of the response and, when the logit link is used, of an odds ratio, unlike the parameters of a linear regression that employs a transformed response. Estimation is performed by maximum likelihood. We provide closed-form expressions for the score function, for Fisher's information matrix and its inverse. Hypothesis testing is performed using approximations obtained from the asymptotic normality of the maximum likelihood estimator. Some diagnostic measures are introduced. Finally, practical applications that employ real data are presented and discussed.},

 abstract={The class of beta regression models is commonly used by practitioners to model variables that assume values in the standard unit interval (0, 1). It is based on the assumption that the dependent variable is beta-distributed and that its mean is related to a set of regressors through a linear predictor with unknown coefficients and a link function. The model also includes a precision parameter which may be constant or depend on a (potentially different) set of regressors through a link function as well. This approach naturally incorporates features such as heteroskedasticity or skewness which are commonly observed in data taking values in the standard unit interval, such as rates or proportions. This paper describes the betareg package which provides the class of beta regressions in the R system for statistical computing. The underlying theory is briefly outlined, the implementation discussed and illustrated in various replication exercises.},

  abstract={In this article, we extend the beta regression model proposed by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004), which is generally useful in situations where the response is restricted to the standard unit interval in two different ways: we let the regression structure to be nonlinear, and we allow a regression structure for the precision parameter (which may also be nonlinear). We derive general formulae for second order biases of the maximum likelihood estimators and use them to define bias-corrected estimators. Our formulae generalize the results obtained by Ospina etÂ al. (2006), and are easily implemented by means of supplementary weighted linear regressions. We compare, by simulation, these bias-corrected estimators with three different estimators which are also bias-free to second order: one analytical, and two based on bootstrap methods. The simulation also suggests that one should prefer to estimate a nonlinear model, which is linearizable, directly in its nonlinear form. Our results additionally indicate that, whenever possible, dispersion covariates should be considered during the selection of the model, as we exemplify with two empirical applications. Finally, we also present simulation results on confidence intervals.},

    abstract = {Regression analysis with a bounded outcome is a common problem in applied statistics. Typical examples include regression models for percentage outcomes and the analysis of ratings that are measured on a bounded scale. In this paper, we consider beta regression, which is a generalization of logit models to situations where the response is continuous on the interval (0,1). Consequently, beta regression is a convenient tool for analyzing percentage responses. The classical approach to fit a beta regression model is to use maximum likelihood estimation with subsequent AIC-based variable selection. As an alternative to this established - yet unstable - approach, we propose a new estimation technique called boosted beta regression. With boosted beta regression estimation and variable selection can be carried out simultaneously in a highly efficient way. Additionally, both the mean and the variance of a percentage response can be modeled using flexible nonlinear covariate effects. As a consequence, the new method accounts for common problems such as overdispersion and non-binomial variance structures.},

The proposed class of models assumes that the response variable has a mixed continuous–discrete distribution with probability mass at zero or one. The beta distribution is used to describe the continuous component of the model, since its density has a wide range of different shapes depending on the values of the two parameters that index the distribution. We use a suitable parameterization of the beta law in terms of its mean and a precision parameter. The parameters of the mixture distribution are modeled as functions of regression parameters. We provide inference, diagnostic, and model selection tools for this class of models. A practical application that employs real data is presented.}
