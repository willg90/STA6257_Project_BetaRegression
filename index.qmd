## Introduction

Beta regression is a statistical methodology tailored to address the
challenges associated with modeling continuous bounded response
variables, often constrained within the open interval (0, 1).  Beta
regression, as introduced by Ferrari & Cribari-Neto (2004) in their
seminal paper, offers an elegant framework for modeling proportions and
percentages with an emphasis on interpretability of model parameters.
This foundational work serves as a cornerstone for subsequent research
and applications.

In beta regression, the dependent variable is assumed to follow a beta
distribution, and the goal is to model its relationship with one or more
independent variables.

The beta regression model can be expressed as the following algorithm

where p, q \> 0 and Γ(·) is the gamma function.

 Beta regression is suitable for data where the response variable lies
within a closed interval, such as proportions, percentages, or rates. It
considers both the mean and the dispersion of the data.

The beta distribution is characterized by two parameters: alpha (α) and
beta (β). These parameters can be modeled as a function of predictor
variables, allowing for the analysis of how independent variables
influence the shape of the distribution.

Like logistic regression, beta regression often uses a link function to
relate the mean of the beta distribution to the linear combination of
predictor variables. Common link functions include logit, probit, and
log-log.

The coefficients obtained from beta regression provide insights into how
changes in the predictor variables affect the distribution of the
response variable, including its mean and variability.

Complementing this, the "betareg" package for R, as presented by
Cribari-Neto & Zeileis (2010), provides various methods and procedures
for implementing beta regression models in R. Building on the foundation
laid by Ferrari and Cribari-Neto (2004), Cribari-Neto & Zeileis (2010)
introduce the "betareg" package for R, offering a practical
implementation of beta regression models. This paper is instrumental in
bringing beta regression into the realm of data analysis and showcases
the package's utility in addressing challenges related to continuous
bounded response variables.

Moreover, the paper authored by Patrícia L. Espinheira, Silvia L.P.
Ferrari, and Francisco Cribari-Neto unveils innovative residuals, based
on Fisher's scoring iterative algorithm, enhancing model assessments and
bias correction---a pivotal contribution to the methodology's practical
applicability. They address a common challenge in statistical analysis
by offering a practical solution for improved model assessments and bias
correction. The study presents new residuals based on Fisher's scoring
iterative algorithm, demonstrating their superiority in various
scenarios, particularly in small sample sizes.

Whereas, Simas, Barreto-Souza, & Rocha (2010) delve into bias correction
methods for beta regression models in the quest for improved estimators
in beta regression. They address biases in parameter estimation, a
critical concern. Recognizing the potential for bias in parameter
estimation, especially in small sample sizes, the paper provides
closed-form expressions for second-order biases in maximum likelihood
estimators. The authors present various methods for bias correction,
including analytical approaches and bootstrap bias adjustment, enhancing
the accuracy of model assessments and mitigating erroneous conclusions.

Various techniques building upon the foundations of (Ferrari &
Cribari-Neto, 2004) have been introduced throughout the years. One such
enhancement is the "boosted beta regression" as a novel extension of
classical beta regression. Schmid et al. (2013) address complex modeling
scenarios with many predictor variables, multicollinearity, nonlinear
relationships, and overdispersion dependencies. They utilize the
gamboostLSS algorithm to efficiently estimate beta regression models,
making it possible to fit models while preserving the structure of beta
regression. The method's effectiveness is demonstrated through
ecological data applications, highlighting its advantages in terms of
model fit and prediction accuracy.

Furthermore, one such limitation of classical beta regression is its
handling of zero or one inflated data. Ospina & Ferrari (2012) introduce
a versatile class of regression models, zero-or-one inflated beta
regression, specifically tailored to address datasets containing
continuous proportions with zeros or ones. The paper offers a flexible
solution for modeling mixed continuous-discrete distributions, essential
in real-world scenarios such as income contributions or work-related
activities. By combining the beta distribution with a degenerate
distribution at zero or one, the authors provide a robust framework for
effective modeling, parameter estimation, diagnostics, and model
selection.
